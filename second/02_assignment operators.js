let c = 5 + b

console.log(c)

//The += Operator

//Ex1
let f = 10
f -= 5

console.log(f)

let g = 10
g *= "5"

console.log(g)

//The **= Operator
//The Exponentiation Assignment Operator raises a variable to the power of the operand.

//Ex1
let h = "10"
h **= "5"

console.log(h)

//The Division Assignment Operator divides a variable.


//Ex1
let i = "10"
i /= "5"
